# webpig üê∑

A web-based host discovery tool that helps you sniff out web-accessible hosts.

## What's This All About?

DNS Pig is a tool designed to help you discover and identify hosts that are accessible through the web. For simple research, I found myself using crt.sh and dnsdumpster quite a lot to determine which subdomains were available, but then had to manually determine which were otherwise reachable/interesting. 

_There are many tools out there, but this one is mine_

## Features

- Web-based interface for easy host discovery
- DNS enumeration capabilities (only crt.sh for now, more to come)
- User-friendly approach to network reconnaissance
- Helps identify potential targets in a web environment

## Getting Started

(Coming soon - installation and usage instructions will be added as the project develops)
